2R Manipulator with Gravity Compensation and Impedance Control
This repository contains code and resources for a 2R manipulator implementing gravity compensation and impedance control using dynamic equations and PD control. This project showcases how to compute the torques for each joint based on the manipulator's parameters and apply impedance control to handle external disturbances.
