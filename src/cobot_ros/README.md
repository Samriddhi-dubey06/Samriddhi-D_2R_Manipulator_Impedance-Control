    ``` 
    ssh cobot@192.168.0.12
    > password: cobot
    ```

2. To run the robot through ROS package, follow these commands :
    ```
    cd tests/build
    sudo ./heal_server
    ```

## Configuration

The following robot parameters/control modes can be configured using the YAML files as mentioned.
_NOTE: The configuration step must be done before proceeding to [Execution](#execution) section._


### Payload
    
Payload defines the properties of the attachment at the end effector of the robot. To modify the payload parameters : 
```
nano ~/catkin_ws/src/cobot_ros/addverb_cobot_control/config/payload_param.yaml 
```

Description of parameters: 
- **payload_status** : Expects a boolean value (`true`/`false`). Use `true`, when you have an attachment at the end-effector, `false` otherwise. If this field is set to `false`, further parameters need not be set in the YAML. 
- **gripper_type** : Expects an integer between 1 to 4, indicating the make of the gripper.
- **mass** : Expects a `double` value, indicating the mass ($kg$) of the attachment.
- **comx, comy, comz** : Expect a `double` value, representing the Centre of Mass (m) of the cumulative system attached at the end-effector.
- **Ixx, Iyy, Izz, Ixy, Ixz, Iyz** : Expect a `double` value, representing the Moment of Inertia ($kg.m^2$) of the cumulative system attached at the end-effector.


<a name="control-mode"></a>
### Control Mode

Control Mode defines the mode in which you want to operate the robot. To modify the control mode : 
```
nano ~/catkin_ws/src/cobot_ros/addverb_cobot_control/config/ros_joint_controllers.yaml 
```

Description of parameters: 
- **ros_control_mode** : Expects a `string` indicating the mode of control (`velocity`/`effort`/`twist`/`joint_trajectory`).


<a name="execution"></a>
## Execution

Open two terminals (hereafter referred to as Terminal 1, and Terminal 2). Execute the following commands in each terminal :
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
```

1. Terminal 1: Launch the controllers by running the following command:
    ```
    roslaunch addverb_cobot_control bringup.launch
    ```
    _NOTE: `RViz` will launched along with `bringup.launch` by default. This can be disabled by specifying `gui:=false` as argument to the above command._
2. Terminal 2: Execute the *default control mode* (i.e., `velocity`). The velocity commands, that is, each element of the array - `data: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` directly controls each joint of the robot. Please run the following node:
    ```
    rosrun examples demo_velocity
    ```
    By default all joint velocities are set to zero. Therefore you will not notice any motion. To modify the control commands you can edit the file at the path :
    ```
    nano ~/ros_ws/src/cobot_ros/examples/src/demo_velocity.cpp
    ```


## Controllers

  - Mode 1 (`velocity`): This is the *default controller*. The velocity commands, that is, each element of the array - `data: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` directly controls each joint of the robot. Before proceeding further, please ensure that the correct controller is set or update as mentioned in [Control Mode](#control-mode) section. Later, run the following command:
    ```
    rosrun examples demo_velocity
    ```
    By default all joint velocities are set to zero. Therefore you will not notice any motion. To modify the control commands you can edit the file at the path :
    ```
    nano ~/ros_ws/src/cobot_ros/examples/src/demo_velocity.cpp
    ```
  - Mode 2 (`effort`): The effort commands, that is, each element of the array - `data: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` directly controls each joint of the robot. Before proceeding further, please ensure that the correct controller is set or update as mentioned in [Control Mode](#control-mode) section. Later, run the following command to directly give effort commands via terminal:
  ```
  rostopic pub -1 /effort_controller/command  std_msgs/Float64MultiArray "data: [-0.6,-18.946, 18.946, 0.892178, 0.386, 1.29]"
  rostopic pub -1 /effort_controller/command  std_msgs/Float64MultiArray "data: [-10 , 0, 0 ,0, 0,  0]"
  
  1st. Joint Angles: J1: -0.897774 J2: 0.305323 J3: 0.0162184 J4: -0.269724 J5: 0.139977 J6: 0.0158351 
  ```
  - Mode 3 (`twist`): Each element of the `Twist` message, controls the direction (`x`, `y`, `z` axes) along which or about which the robot's end-effector will move. Each element of the twist message can only have a value belonging to the set `{-1, 0, 1}`, where -1 means movement along negative direction of chosen axis, +1 means movement along positive direction of chosen axis and 0 means no movement. Before proceeding further, please ensure that the correct controller is set or update as mentioned in [Control Mode](#control-mode) section. Later, run the following command:
    ```
    rosrun examples demo_twist
    ```
    By default all the twist components are set to zero, to modify the control commands you can edit the file at the path :
    ```
    gedit ~/ros_ws/src/cobot_ros/examples/src/demo_twist.cpp
    ```
  - Mode 4 (`joint_trajectory`): 
    - Case I: It demonstrates sending goal postions one by one. Each `JointTrajectory` message, provides goal position along with the time desired to achieve the goal. Before proceeding further, please ensure that the correct controller is set or update as mentioned in [Control Mode](#control-mode) section. Later, run the following command:
        ```
        rosrun examples demo_joint_trajectory
        ```
        To modify the control commands you can edit the file at the path :
        ```
        nano ~/ros_ws/src/cobot_ros/examples/src/demo_joint_trajectory.cpp
        ```

    - Case II: It demonstrates sending goal postions all at once. Each `JointTrajectory` message, provides all goal positions along with the time desired to achieve each goal position. **NOTE** : A minimum of _three_ goal positions must be specified in this case. Also, the time desired to achieve the goal position must be incremental, i.e., Please ensure that time given for (i+1)th goal position must be greater than time specified for ith goal position. Before proceeding further, please ensure that the correct controller is set or update as mentioned in [Control Mode](#control-mode) section. Later, run the following command:
        ```
        rosrun examples demo_multi_trajectory
        ```
        To modify the control commands you can edit the file at the path :
        ```
        nano ~/ros_ws/src/cobot_ros/examples/src/demo_multi_trajectory.cpp
        ```


## Gripper Control

- Open grippper
    - Demo node:
        ```
        ros2 run examples demo_gripper_open
        ```
    - Terminal command
        ```
        ros2 action send_goal /GripperAction addverb_cobot_msgs/action/Gripper "{event: 2, grasp_force: 0}"
        ```
- Close grippper
    - Demo node:
        ```
        ros2 run examples demo_gripper_close
        ```
    - Terminal command
        ```
        ros2 action send_goal /GripperAction addverb_cobot_msgs/action/Gripper "{event: 3, grasp_force: 50}"
        ```
        To changes gripper grasping force, change values of `goal_msg.grasp_force` in `src/examples/demo_gripper_close.cpp line:43`.


## Troubleshooting

1. Go back to the base pose (if required): The following command should be executed inside the cobot. Therefore, please do `ssh cobot@192.168.0.12` as suggested at [Setup Robot](#setup-robot) section.
    ``` 
    sudo ./tests/base_rigid
    
    ```
    
## Setting up the effort controller for heal
1. Go to heal_ws/src/cobot_ros/addverb_cobot_control/config, inside default controllers.yaml set the ros_control_mode to "effort".
2. Go to heal_ws/src/cobot_ros/addverb_cobot_control/include, inside addverb_cobot_hw.h add necessary packages and libraries:

// ROS control

#include <std_msgs/Float64MultiArray.h>
#include <urdf/model.h>
#include <kdl/tree.hpp>
#include <kdl/chain.hpp>
#include <kdl_parser/kdl_parser.hpp>
#include <kdl/chainfksolverpos_recursive.hpp>
#include <kdl/chaindynparam.hpp>
#include <kdl/jntarray.hpp>

3. Go to heal_ws/src/cobot_ros/addverb_cobot_control/launch, inside bringup.launch in "args" set "effort_controller".

4. Go to heal_ws/src/cobot_ros/addverb_cobot_control/src, inside addverb_cobot_hw.cpp add gravity compensation part inside the effort_controller section, that basically incudes the mass, coriolis and gravity torques.
5. Go to heal_ws/src/cobot_ros/addverb_cobot_control/package.xml, set up the required dependencies like:

 <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>
  <build_depend>addverb_cobot_msgs</build_depend>
  <build_depend>roscpp</build_depend>
  <build_depend>actionlib</build_depend>
  <build_export_depend>roscpp</build_export_depend>
  <build_depend>sensor_msgs</build_depend>
  <build_depend>std_msgs</build_depend>
  <build_depend>joint_limits_interface</build_depend>
  <build_depend>addverb_cobot_controllers</build_depend>
  
  <exec_depend>addverb_cobot_msgs</exec_depend>
  <exec_depend>roscpp</exec_depend>
  <exec_depend>actionlib</exec_depend>
  <exec_depend>sensor_msgs</exec_depend>
  <exec_depend>joint_limits_interface</exec_depend>
  <exec_depend>addverb_cobot_controllers</exec_depend>
  <exec_depend>std_msgs</exec_depend>
  
  
6. Make changes in heal_ws/src/cobot_ros/addverb_cobot_control/CMakeLists.txt as well.

7. # Steps to Check and Launch the Effort Controller

Follow these steps to ensure the `effort_controller` is working correctly. Once completed, you can use the `free_drive` mode to observe changes in torque values.

### Step 1: Verify connectivity by pinging the robot
```
ping 192.168.1.25
```

### Step 2: Establish an SSH connection to the robot
```
ssh cobot@192.168.1.25
```

### Step 3: Navigate to the test build directory
```
cd tests/build
```

### Step 4: Check the available files
```
ls
```

### Step 5: Run the Heal server with sudo permissions
```
sudo ./heal_server
```

### Step 6: Open another terminal and launch the effort_controller
```
cd Heal_ws

```

```
source devel/setup.bash
```

```
roslaunch addverb_cobot_control bringup.launch
```

After completing the steps, the `effort_controller` will be launched. While using `free_drive`, you can see the changes in torque values.
